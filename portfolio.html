The image can be seen in the portfolio, and this is the final product.  I created a bokeh effect with slight movement using JavaScript, and a star field generated using boxshadows in CSS.  The quote doesn't include any additional elements(other than the dynamically created ones via JS), and is styled by simply adding a single class to the standard blockquote structure.</p>

                            <p>This is a WordPress plugin for the Jasmine JavaScript testing framework.  This plugin allows developers to run their Jasmine unit tests in the WordPress dashboard, so they can get visual confirmation of passing/failing tests without the need to run CLI.  This was predominately developed for use in conjunction with the BoldGrid SEO plugin, which was heavily reliant on JavaScript, and I wanted to provide a way for a normal user as well as a developer to run the unit tests before we publish the code for release to the public which had code coverage of all the functionality of the plugin.</p>

                            <p>This was the flagship theme for a company called BoldGrid.  My goal with this theme was to ensure that it had partiy with the top WordPress themes in paid and free marketplaces.  Aside from this the theme is ran based on configuration options, and can be fully customized to generate new themes by simply changing a couple of settings in a config file.  Things like color palettes can be automatically generated and applied, font-sizes, header and footer layouts, blog designs, and much more.  The majority of time invested in this project went into creating options in the WordPress customizer using the customizer's JavsScript API.  Many custom controls were created to give end users fine grain control over all of their website design choices.</p>

                            <p>PostCSS is a tool to transform CSS using JavaScript.  It's extremely useful for correcting/enforcing specific CSS styles, and for creating dynamically generated styles from user input.  As I worked with PostCSS I ran into some needs for additional rules to enforce, and bugs with some existing libraries.  Here's some of the work I've done with PostCSS:</p>

Knapp Consultants was trying to have something that was kind of silly, but still relevant for the topic of the book.</p>

                            <p>This plugin was developed for a company called BoldGrid.  The primary focus of this plugin was to provide a feature packed SEO plugin that had a lightweight and easy to use interface that still gave clients all the right tools to ensure they are writing great content for climbing up the SERPs.  This plugin was mostly designed using JavaScript and some light PHP usage, and provide realtime insights and feedback on the content being written.  The plugin itself was also written to be fully covered by unit testing, which helped when identifying bugs, and when fixing or creating new features for it.</p>

                            <p>I was called into this project to help get it to it's deadline as there were delays with the group working on it.  My main objective was to provide front-end design, and help with wrapping up any code that I could.  This project was unique in terms of JavaScript development as I was forced to use the Prototype library that Plesk uses for modifying the frontend components.  Prototype is an older library that is seldomly used in newer projects today.  This was my first time working on a Plesk extension, but they provided detailed documentation that made most things very easy to understand.</p>

                            <p>Sometimes I like to challenge myself in designing different aspects of a project, and one area I like to experiment with is with logo implementations.  As part of a optimization of a site, it's important to reduce as many external resources as possible, and also optimize any assets you have displayed.  By rendering a logo in pure CSS format, you can often times save a few bytes throughout pageloads which can really add up.  This is an example of a logo for the company "Mediavine", which focuses on full service ad management software for WordPress.</p>

Knapp Consultants wanted something simple, yet complex, and with a little bit of coloration in it, but nothing blinding. This description seemed like it was full of conflicting ideas when present, so I went ahead and began designing the cover right away. This is the end result of “Attitude is Everything.”  This was the first cover I had done for the company, and eventually led to many more book design covers for them and other authors under the same publisher.</p>
